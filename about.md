I'm Daniel Temesgen, a Software Engineer in the ML Platform Team at Expedia Group, interested in tools which simplify 
the Model Lifecycle and deployment at scale.

I started in tech after graduating with a First Class Honours in Chemistry from University College London in 2017. 
Following that, I did several graduate rotations at Barclays in Data Analysis and applied ML across business banking, 
credit cards, payments, and customer research. Tracking down, transforming and visualising data was fun, but I 
increasingly became interested in making our analytics repeatable and well-tested. This got me thinking about things 
through a software lens. After the graduate scheme, I worked on Analytics Engineering within the Business Bank, looking 
at spend categorisation, mortgage market simulation and geospatial analysis.

After picking up Python and running [internal workshops](https://github.com/DanielTemesgen/python-workshops), I started 
a part-time Computer Science MSc at the University of York. During this time, I was learning about Kubernetes, Platform 
Engineering and how it could make productionising ML easier. After a stint as an MLE in Experian putting this into 
practice, I joined the ML Platform Team at Expedia Group where we develop tools and services to simplify the Model 
Lifecycle for real-time and batch inference.
