#### [Python Workshops](https://github.com/DanielTemesgen/python-workshops)
A repo for python workshops I have given. Blog post for the first workshop on Scikit-Learn pipelines [here](https://danieltemesgen.github.io/words/2019/08/14/scikit-learn-pipelines.html).

#### [Turn the Page Bot](https://github.com/DanielTemesgen/turn-the-page-bot)
I wanted to learn about APIs and deploying apps to the cloud. I made a simple [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/turnthepagebot) which tweets the lyrics to a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flt1I1U74h4) on a loop, in perpetuity. In doing so I learned about ephemeral file systems and the need for [persistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)) cloud-applications.

#### [This Website](https://danieltemesgen.github.io)
This website is written with Jekyll. For structural clarity this website runs from two separate github repos, for content and thematic elements respectively. This is possible due to the jekyll-remote-theme plugin, the theme has been adapted from [this repo](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss) via a Fork, with additions including buttons for LinkedIn and Email on the home page.
