Here's a list of things I've worked on:

#### [Py Utils](https://github.com/DanielTemesgen/py-utils)
Some simple utils I've developed for ml projects. I'll be adding to this over time. Blog post [here](https://danieltemesgen.github.io/words/2019/07/27/ml-utils.html).

#### [Turn the Page Bot](https://github.com/DanielTemesgen/turn_the_page_bot)
I wanted to learn about APIs and deploying apps to the cloud. I made a simple [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/turnthepagebot) which tweets the lyrics to a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flt1I1U74h4) on a loop, in perpetuity. In doing so I learned about ephemeral file systems and the need for [persistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)) cloud-applications.

#### [4D Graph Template](https://github.com/DanielTemesgen/4D-Graph-Template)
This project was originally developed from an example on the Bokeh website. I widened the scope of this visualisation, allowing anyone to view a summarised dataset four-dimensionally without any knowledge of Python. Additional style settings were exposed to the user via iPython widgets, as well as the ability to save plots to png cleanly.

#### [This Website](https://danieltemesgen.github.io)
This website is written with Jekyll. For structural clarity this website runs from two separate github repos, for content and thematic elements respectively. This is possible due to the jekyll-remote-theme plugin, the theme has been adapted from [this repo](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss) via a Pull Request, with additions including buttons for LinkedIn and Email on the home page.
