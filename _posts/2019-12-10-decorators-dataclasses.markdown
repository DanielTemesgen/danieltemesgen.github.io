I've added to the python workshops repo with a guide on Python Decorators, the advantages of Dataclasses, and the benefits of using an IDE [Here](https://github.com/DanielTemesgen/python-workshops).

It explains the benefits of python decorators for centralising complexity, as well as running through some examples on potential uses such as Timing and Logging.
