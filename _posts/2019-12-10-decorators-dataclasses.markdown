I've added to the python workshops repo with a guide on Python Decorators, the advantages of Dataclasses, and the benefits of using an IDE [Here][repo-link].

It explains the benefits of python decorators for centralising complexity, as well as running through some examples on potential uses such as Timing and Logging.

One last thing, I've been toying with the new Github Actions functionality, which brings long-awaited CI/CD to Github. Now whenever I make a change to the python-workshops repo, a Github Action will convert my notebook to a set of slides and host it on Github pages. I'll make a short post explaining it soon.
