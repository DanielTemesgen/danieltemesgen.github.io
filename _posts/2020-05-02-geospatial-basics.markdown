I've added to the python workshops repo with a guide on the basics of Geospatial Analytics.

We'll be going through:
* Data gathering and manipulation with `geopandas`
* Interactive visualisation with `hvplot`
* Rapid nearest neighbour calculation with `kdtrees`
* Calculating voronoi regions with `scipy.spatial`
* Spatial joins

To do this we'll be exploring TFL station data and generating 1000 random points in London to work with.

There's also a couple of challenges at the end!

P.S On a technical note, I’ve switched from using Jupyter Notebook to JupyterLab for these workshops, the dark theme is a lot easier on the eyes!

P.P.S Got something you’d like me to write a post about? Feel free to raise a GitHub issue on the python-workshops repo and I’ll see what I can do.
