I've added to the python workshops repo with a guide on the basics of Geospatial Analytics.

We'll be going through:
* Data Gathering and manipulation with `geopandas`
* Interactive visualisation with `hvplot`
* Rapid nearest neighbour calculation with `kdtrees`
* Calculating voronoi regions with `scipy.spatial`
* Spatial Joins

To do this we'll be exploring TFL station data and generating 1000 random points in London to work with.

There's also a couple of challenges at the end!
